Telegram and Discord bots for DreamLand MUD

## Telegram bot, Hassan

This bot uses [Telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf) library. You can easily create your own bot by [chatting to Bot Father](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)
and use it for testing the commands available via DreamLand API.

* Get the bot token from Bot Father and export it in an environment variable, for example:
```bash
export BOT_TOKEN=110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw
```

* Run the bot locally:
```bash
cd telegram
npm i
npm run start
```

* In Telegram, invite the bot to a channel or chat privately. Try sending `/start` and `/help` commands.
